### 概述
SARS幸存者的记忆B细胞中确定了几种感兴趣的单克隆抗体
位于冠状病毒的刺突结构中的感染性复合物刺突蛋白（S蛋白）三聚体，对冠状病毒能够识别宿主细胞表面上的ACE2受体、与之融合并将它们的遗传物质注入到宿主细胞中的能力至关重要。

S309抗体是保守抗体能抵抗多病毒。

 

单独或混合使用S309抗体限制冠状病毒形成突变体的能力，使得它们不能够逃避单个抗体的治疗。

Eight out of the twenty-five mAbs bound to CHO cells that express SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein or SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, with half-maximal effective concentration values 

These results suggest that S306 and S310 may recognize post-fusion SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, which has recently been proposed to be abundant on the surface of authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses

We determined 3D reconstructions at 3.7 Å and 3.1 Å resolution, respectively, of the ectodomain trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein with a single open SBdomain and in a closed state (apply- ing three-fold symmetry), both with three S309 Fabs bound 

S309 recognizes a proteoglycan epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 S , distinct from the receptor-binding motif. The epitope is accessible in both the open and closed states of the S glycoprotein, which explains the stoichiometric binding of Fab to the trimer of the S glycoprotein

The 20-residue-long CDRH3 sits atop the SBhelix that com- prises residues 337–344, and also contacts the edge of the SB5-stranded β-sheet (residues 356–361), overall accounting for about 50% of the buried surface area

CDRH3 and CDRL2 sandwich the glycan of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein at posi- tion N343, through contacts with the core fucose moiety (consistent with a previous study that detected SARS-CoV-2 N343 core-fucosylated peptides by mass spectrometry16) and to a lesser extent with the other saccharides within the glycan chain

The structural data explain the S309 cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, as 17 out of 22 residues of the epitope are strictly conserved

The cryo-EM structure of S309 bound to SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein presented here, combined with the structures of SARS-CoV-2 SBand SARS-CoV SBin complex with ACE2, indicate18–20,43that the Fab engages an epitope distinct from the receptor-binding motif and would not clash with ACE2 upon binding to S glycoprotein

Biolayer interferom- etry analysis of S309 Fab or IgG binding to the SARS-CoV-2 SBdomain or the ectodomain trimer of S glycoprotein confirmed the absence of competition between S309 and ACE2 for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein

To further investigate the mechanism of S309-mediated neutraliza- tion, we compared side-by-side infection of SARS-CoV-2–MLV in the presence of either S309 Fab or S309 IgG. Both experiments yielded comparable IC50values (3.8 and 3.5 nM, respectively), indicating similar potencies for IgG and Fab

However, S309 IgG-mediated neu- tralization reached 100%, whereas neutralization plateaued at about 80% in the presence of S309 Fab

IgG-specific bivalent mechanisms—such as S-glycoprotein trimer cross-linking, steric hindrance or aggregation of virions44—may contribute to the ability of S309 to fully neutralize pseudovirions.

Fc-dependent effector mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediated by natural killer cells, can contribute to viral control in individuals infected with virus. We observed efficient S309- and S306-mediated ADCC of SARS-CoV-2 S-glycoprotein-transfected cells, whereas the other mAbs that we tested showed limited or no activity

ADCC was observed only using natural killer (effector) cells that express the high-affinity FcγRIIIa variant (V158) but not the low-affinity variant (F158) (fig.d)

These results, which we confirmed using a FcγRIIIa cell reporter assay (Fig. 3e), suggest that S309 Fc engineering could poten- tially enhance the activation of natural killer cells with the low-affinity FcγRIIIa variant (F158)

However, FcγRIIa signalling was observed only for S309 (fig.g)

To gain more insight into the epitopes recognized by our panel of mAbs, we used structural information, escape mutant analysis26,32,35and biolayer-interferometry-based epitope binning to map the antigenic sites that are present on the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 SBdomains

Given the lower number of mAbs that cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, we were able to identify site IV targeted by S309 and S303, and sites II and III targeted by S304 and S315 (Fig. 4b).

Although S304 and S315 alone were weakly neutralizing, the combination of either of these mAbs with S309 resulted in an enhanced neutralization potency, compared to single mAbs, against both SARS-CoV-2–MLV  and authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Figs. 1f, 4c, d). 

In summary, our study identifies S309 as a human mAb that has broad neutralizing activity against multiple sarbecoviruses (includ- ing SARS-CoV-2), via recognition of a highly conserved epitope in the SBdomain that comprises the N343 glycan (N330 in SARS-CoV S gly- coprotein). Furthermore, S309 can recruit effector mechanisms and showed increased neutralization in combination with weakly neutraliz- ing mAbs, which may mitigate the risk of viral escape. Our data indicate the potential to discover potently neutralizing pan-sarbecovirus mAbs, define antigenic sites to include in vaccine design and pave the way to support preparedness for future outbreaks of sarbecoviruses. As S309 shows promise as an effective countermeasure to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, Fc variants of S309 with increased half-life and effector functions have entered an accelerated develop- ment path towards clinical trials.
