# 康复患者B细胞高通量单细胞测序鉴定的抗SARS-CoV-2的中和抗体


人体免疫系统产生的中和抗体可以有效防止病毒感染细胞。靶向性中和抗体可以作为血浆治疗的有效成分。

**方法：**


8558个抗原结合的IgG1+克隆型（clonotype）中筛选出14种高强效中和抗体。

BD-368-2抗体对SARS-CoV-2具有较强的治疗效果和预防保护作用：将BD-368-2抗体注射到受感染的小鼠体内时，病毒载量降低了约2400倍；将BD-368-2抗体注射到未受感染的小鼠体内时，它们免受病毒感染.

We performed small conditional RNA (scRNA) and scVDJ sequencing on the freshly isolated B cells or CD27+memory B cell subsets using 10X Chromium 50mRNA and VDJ sequencing

To enrich for RBD-binding B cells, we utilized both biotinylated RBD and S protein to select for antigen-binding B cells through magnetic beads separation

the scRNA-seq data enabled us to perform cell-typing based on mRNA expression for memory B cell identifications

First, only enriched clonotypes containing IgG1-expressing B cells were selected (Figure 1C）

The most potent mAb BD-368-2, which was selected from the same clonotype as BD-368 (Figure 1C), ex- hibited an IC50of 1.2 ng/mL.

To increase the efficiency of neutralizing mAbs identification, we developed a set of criteria to filter out the clonotypes that have low chances to produce neutralizing mAbs (Figure 1D).

We further screened all ELISA-positive mAbs for neutralizing ability using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovi- rus system. We found that only RBD-binding mAbs showed pseudovirus neutralization effects (Figure 1E)

Both full-length S protein and the RBD protein could enrich for RBD-binding mAbs but with distinct efficiency (Figure 1F).

Among all the neutralizing mAbs isolated from enriched clono- types, seven of them showed potent neutralization ability with an IC50lower than 0.05mg/mL against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Figures 2A and 2C)

To evaluate their neutralization potential against the authentic virus, we performed the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 patients. Among all mAbs tested, BD-368-2 dis- played the highest potency against the authentic virus with an IC50of 15 ng/mL (Figures 2B and 2C).

A total of 9 hACE2 transgenic mice were used in this study and were equally split into three groups (n = 3). The prophylactic efficacy was examined by intraperitoneally injecting 20 mg/kg (of mice body weight) BD-368-2 into hACE2 transgenic mice 24 h before viral infection (Figure 3A)

We recorded the body weight for each mice daily after infection for 5 days (Fig- ure 3A) and found that the therapeutic and prophylactic treat- ment groups maintained their body weight, whereas the negative control group significantly lost weight (Figure 3B)

 

This indicates that BD-368-2 applied both before and after the infection could greatly improve the physiological condition of the SARS-CoV- 2-infected mice.

Moreover, we analyzed the viral load by qRT- PCR of the lungs at 5 dpi (Yang et al.,2007) and found that injec- tions of BD-368-2 before the viral challenge could completely inhibit SARS-CoV-2  

 

Furthermore, applying BD- 368-2 2 h after infection could result in a 3–4 log decrease in virus copies in mice lung, indicating an effective reduction of SARS- CoV-2 replication (Figure 3C). Together, BD-368-2 exhibits high therapeutic and prophylactic efficacyin vivo.

To date, no SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb structures are recorded in the Protein Database (PDB), which could serve as a reference. To address this, we solved the cryo-EM structure of BD23-Fab in complex with the S ectodomain trimer at an overall resolution of 3.8 A 

 

The S ectodomain here adopts an asymmetric confor- mation as previously reported (Wrapp et al., 2020), with the RBD in one protomer (mol A) adopting an ‘‘up’’ position, whereas the other two RBDs (mol B and C) adopt ‘‘down’’ positions. In this 3D reconstruction, a single BD23-Fab is observed per S trimer, and it binds the ‘‘down’’ RBD in protomer B. Only the heavy chain variable domain of BD-23 is involved in binding to the RBD (Figure 4B).

In fact, a comparison with the RBD-ACE2 complex structure demon- strates that BD23-Fab competes with ACE2 for binding to RBD (Figure 4C).

The CDR3Hsequence of the identified mAbs shared high homology with m396 (2dd8) (Figure 5A), which neutralizes SARS-CoV by disrupting ACE2/RBD binding (Figure 5D). 

The CDR3 sequence comparison between SARS-CoV-neutralizing mAb m396 and the SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs identified based on CDR3Hstructure similarity.

Surprisingly, we found that 7 out of the 12 mAbs exhibited a strong RBD-binding affinity and a potent neutralizing ability against pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2(Figures 5B and 5C)
 

 Moreover, these mAbs were mostly encoded by VH3- 66/JH6 or VH3-53/JH6 gene segments for the heavy chain and VLK1-9 or VLK1D-33/39 for the light chain (Figure 5C)

The neutralization abilities of three representative mAbs, BD-503, BD-508, and BD-515, were also verified in the PRNT against authentic SARS-CoV-2 and showed high potencies (Figures 5E and 5F).

Indeed, epitope binning experiments using a double-antibodies sandwich ELISA has shown that BD-503, BD-508, and BD-515 likely share an overlapping epitope (Fig- ure 6). However, more structural analysis is needed to obtain the exact epitopes to confirm whether they are largely conserved.
